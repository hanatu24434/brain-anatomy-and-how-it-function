                vision,breathing,temperature, and many other functions that regulate the body.
                it is made up of billions of cells called neurons.it also response to how people
                respond to stressful situation (i.e.writing of an exam,loss of a job,
                birth of a child,illness.etc) by regulating heart and breathing rates.
