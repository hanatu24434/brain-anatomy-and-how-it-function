              <p class="para1">the brain is a complex organ that control thought,
                memory,emotion,touch,motorskill
            vision,breathing,temperature, and many other functions that regulate the body.
            it is made up of billions of cells called neurons.it also response to how people
            respond to stressful situation (i.e.writing of an exam,loss of a job,
            birth of a child,illness.etc) by regulating heart and breathing rates.

                is a complex organ divided into three main part :the cerebrum, 
                cerebellum, and the brain stem.
